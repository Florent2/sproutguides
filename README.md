SproutGuides
============

Documentation for the SproutCore framework. For more information on SproutCore,
see the [homepage](http://www.sproutcore.com) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore).
These guides are based on the [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/).


## Getting Started

In order to start generating documentation, complete the following steps:

- install the [SproutGuides package](http://guides-pkg.strobeapp.com/Guides.pkg)
- clone SproutGuides from git://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides.git

Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to start working with
SproutGuides. You'll do your work inside the source/ directory. To see
your changes as you work, run `guides preview`. By default, preview will
show guides and content that is still under construction. Under
construction content is not displayed on guides.sproutcore.com, if you
would like to see what content will be deployed run
`guides preview --production`.

If you have any questions, the team can be reached at [@sproutcore](http://twitter.com/#!/sproutcore)
or [#sproutcore](irc://irc.freenode.net/sproutcore)
