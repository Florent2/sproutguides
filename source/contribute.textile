* "Guides are hosted on GitHub":http://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides
* Guides are written in Textile, and reside at railties/guides/source in the docrails project.
* For now, follow the "Rails Guides Conventions":https://github.com/lifo/docrails/wiki/rails-guides-conventions.
* Assets are stored in the +assets+ directory.
* Sample format: "Fixtures":http://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides/blob/master/source/fixtures.textile.
* Sample output: "Fixtures":http://guides.sproutcore.com/fixtures.html.

h3. What to Contribute?

* We need authors, editors, proofreaders, and translators. Adding a single paragraph of quality content to a guide is a good way to get started.
* The easiest way to start is by improving an existing guide:
** Improve the structure to make it more coherent.
** Add missing information.
** Correct any factual errors.
** Fix typos or improve style.
** Bring it up to date with the latest release of SproutCore.
* We're also open to suggestions for entire new guides:
** Contact the documentation team to get your idea approved. See the Contact section below.

h3. How is the process?

* Fork the "repo from Github":http://github.com/sproutcore/sproutguides
* Send a pull request and we will review your changes.
* If you are a regular committer we will give you direct commit access.
