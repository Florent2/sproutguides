h2. Getting Started With HTML-Based Apps

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

* Use SproutCore's templating support to describe the appearance of your application.
* Delegate handling of user events with views.
* Use bindings to update views when your models change.

You will learn all of this by building a real Todo list application from the ground up using SproutCore.

endprologue.

h3. Generate Your New Application

First, generate your new HTML-based application.

<shell>
$ sc-init todos --template
</shell>

This will create several files needed for your application, inside the *+apps/todos+* directory.

* *apps/*
** *todos/*
*** *todos.js* - The JavaScript file that will define your models, views, and controllers
*** *resources/*
**** *templates/* - Place all Handlebars templates here.
***** *todos.handlebars* - The main template for the application
**** *images/* - Place all image assets here.
**** *stylesheets/* - Place all css here
***** *todos.css* - The CSS to style your views
*** *tests/*
* *Buildfile* - Tells SproutCore how your application should be built. Usually, you can just use the defaults provided.
* *README*

Go ahead and open +todos.js+ now. You should see the following code:

<javascript filename="apps/todos/todos.js">
Todos = SC.Application.create();

SC.ready(function() {
  Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({
    layerId: "todo",
    templateName: "todos"
  });
});
</javascript>

This code creates a namespace for your application (called +Todos+), then appends a new pane. A pane is responsible for event delegation and placing your templates into the DOM, but you'll learn more about that later.

INFO: If you pass a camelcase name to +sc-init+, such as +ToDos+ &mdash; notice the uppercase 'D' &mdash;, the namespace would instead be +ToDos+ and the directories would be named with underscores (i.e. *+apps/to_dos*)

h3. Defining Your Model

In this tutorial, we want to create a list for managing todos. Users should be able to create a new todo with a specific task, then check it off once it's done.

Let's define our model as a new subclass of +SC.Object+:

<javascript filename="apps/todos/todos.js">
Todos = SC.Application.create();

Todos.Todo = SC.Object.extend({
  title: null,
  isDone: false
});

SC.ready(function() {
  Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({
    layerId: 'todos',
    templateName: 'todos'
  });
});
</javascript>

NOTE: Make sure you insert the new code after the +Todos+ object is created.

We've now defined a class with two properties: +title+, a string, and +isDone+, a Boolean.

h3. Managing the Model Using a Controller

Now that we know what our data looks like, let's create a controller to manage it. Since we want to maintain an ordered list of todos, we'll use an instance of +SC.ArrayController+.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// at the end of the file

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({
  // Initialize the array controller with an empty array.
  content: []
});
</javascript>

INFO: In MVC frameworks, like SproutCore, the controller layer bridges the model layer, which is only concerned with a pure-data representation of objects, and the view layer, which is only concerned with representing those objects.

Now we have an array controller with no content. Let's add a method to create a new todo:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating previous code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({
  // Initialize the array controller with an empty array.
  content: [],

  // Creates a new todo with the passed title, then adds it
  // to the array.
  createTodo: function(title) {
    var todo = Todos.Todo.create({ title: title });
    this.pushObject(todo);
  }
});
</javascript>

NOTE: +SC.ArrayController+ acts as a proxy onto its +content+ Array. SproutCore will propagate any modifications made to the +ArrayController+ to the +content+ Array.

h3. Creating New Todos with a Text Field

NOTE: We've provided a simple stylesheet to give the application some style.  At this point, you should download "the CSS":https://github.com/sproutcore/Todos-Example/raw/master/apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos.css and replace the empty file that sc-init generated for us at +apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos.css+.

We've got our model and controller set up, so let's move on to the fun part: creating the interface for our users. The first step is to create a text field into which the user types the name of their todo.  SproutCore's TemplateView uses Handlebars templates to quickly define the application's interface.  While Handlebars makes it easier to markup HTML quickly, you'll see that it has been extended to take advantage of SproutCore with very little additional effort.

To start building our views, let's open +resources/templates/todos.handlebars+.  You'll see that the initialization pre-populated the file with a snippet of HTML:

<html filename="todos.handlebars">
<h1>Welcome to SproutCore!</h1>
</html>

Go ahead and replace that with:

<html filename="todos.handlebars">
<h1>Todos</h1>
<input id="new-todo" type="text"
       placeholder="What needs to be done?" >
</html>

NOTE: For more information about using Handlebars, visit the "Handlebars website":http://handlebars.strobeapp.com/.

Now that we've got model, view, and controller represented, it's time to open the app in our browser and see how it looks.

During the development process, +sc-server+ makes it easy to test your application. Just run the following inside of your project directory:

<shell>
$ sc-server

Starting server at http://0.0.0.0:4020 in debug mode
To quit sc-server, press Control-C
>> Thin web server (v1.2.1 codename Bat-Shit Crazy)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4020, CTRL+C to stop
</shell>

Open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:4020/todos":http://localhost:4020/todos. You should see your application load. Once you've verified that the application is up and running, it's time to tell SproutCore how to handle events for your <code><input></code> tag. When the user types in the field and presses +return+, we will create a new Todo and have it inserted into the content of the array controller.

NOTE: In SproutCore, view objects are responsible for updating the DOM and handling events.  For instance, this allows us to buffer changes to the DOM for maximum performance and to support generic cross-platform event handling.  Whenever you want to display dynamic content or handle events, you will use a view object.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.CreateTodoView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.TextFieldSupport, {
  insertNewline: function() {
    var value = this.get('value');

    if (value) {
      Todos.todoListController.createTodo(value);
      this.set('value', '');
    }
  }
});
</javascript>

Since +CreateTodoView+ contains a text field, we should use the mixin +SC.TextFieldSupport+, which provides several conveniences, including a +value+ property, and higher level events such as +insertNewline+, for when the user presses +return+.

NOTE: When creating a new object, you can include a mixin, which will extend the default behavior of the class. In this case, we extend the default +TemplateView+ behavior with functionality specific to views that wrap input tags. You can include as many mixins as you'd like by passing them as parameters to +create()+ and +extend()+.

Now that we have defined our view, we need to attach it to HTML in our Handlebars template.  Wrap the <code><input></code> like so:

<html filename="apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<h1>Todos</h1>
{{#view Todos.CreateTodoView}}
<input id="new-todo" type="text"
       placeholder="What needs to be done?" />
{{/view}}
</html>

+#view+ is a Handlebars block helper that assigns a +SC.TemplateView+ to a section of HTML. This means that the behavior described in the specified view, such as event handling, will get associated with the HTML inside the block.

Now that we have an interface to create new todos, let's create the interface to display them.  We'll use the Handlebars +#collection+ helper to display a list of items. +#collection+ will create an instance of +SC.TemplateCollectionView+ that renders every item in its underlying Array using the enclosed HTML.

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- at the end of the file -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView}}
  {{content.title}}
{{/collection}}
</html>

Notice that we've associated a class to the +collection+ helper, which doesn't yet exist. So back in +todos.js+, we need to also define the collection class Todos.TodoListView.  At the same time, we will bind the collection view's +content+ property to the +content+ of our +todoListController+. With the above template, for each item in the todoListController's +content+ array, +TodoListView+ will render the block <code>{{content.title}}</code>, which will simply create a <code><div></code> containing the item's +title+.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// at the end of the file

Todos.TodoListView = SC.TemplateCollectionView.extend({
  contentBinding: 'Todos.todoListController'
});
</javascript>

NOTE: You set up bindings by creating a property whose name ends in +Binding+. In this case, we bind +Todos.todoListController+ to the +Todos.TodoListView+'s +content+ property. When one end of a binding changes, SproutCore will automatically update the other end.

This is a good time to visit "http://localhost:4020/todos":"http://localhost:4020/todos in your browser (or reload if you still have it open). It should look the same as before. Type a todo into the text field and hit return.

Look at that! As soon as we create a new todo and insert it into the array controller, the view updates automatically.

You've now seen a little bit of the power of SproutCore. By using SproutCore's bindings to describe the relationship between your data and your views, you were able to change the data layer and let SproutCore do the hard work of updating the view layer for you.

INFO: This is actually a core concept in SproutCore, not just something that demos well.  SproutCore's binding system is designed with the view system in mind, which makes it easy to work directly with your data and not need to worry about manually keeping your view layer in sync. You will see this concept over and over again in the rest of this tutorial and in other guides.

h3. Getting Things Done

We now have the ability to add todos, but no way to mark them as done. Before the frustration of a never-ending todo list gets the better of us, let's add the ability to mark todos complete.

The first thing we need to do is add a checkbox to each todo list item. As was mentioned earlier, if we want to handle events, such as user input, we need a view to manage that portion of HTML. In this case, we are adding a checkbox and want to be notified whenever the value of the checkbox is changed by the user. Remember that we can assign views using the +#view+ helper and provide the HTML content for the assigned view in our template.  However, we can also reference views that provide their own HTML content using the +view+ helper &mdash; notice the lack of the #.  For instance, we may want to create a complex view that will be used repeatedly and don't want to have to update all the templates whenever it needs to be updated.  Here's what the todo list looks like after updating it in +todos.handlebars+:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- replacing the previous code -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView}}
    {{view Todos.CheckboxView}}
{{/collection}}
</html>

Now implement +Todos.CheckboxView+, which we just referenced. Since our view will wrap an +input+ tag of type +checkbox+, we will mix in +SC.CheckboxSupport+. This gives the view a +value+ property that reflects the value in the DOM, and, because it is a SproutCore property, we can observe any changes to it.

INFO: Under the hood, SproutCore binds an event handler to the +change+ event and updates +value+ when the event occurs. This may change as needed for browser compatibility, and working with a SproutCore property insulates you from those concerns.

For every item in its underlying +Array+, +SC.TemplateCollectionView+ will create a new child view whose +content+ property contains the object the view should represent. In our case, there will be a child view for each todo, and each will have a +content+ property set to a corresponding +Todo+ object.

This makes it easy to bind the value of the checkbox to the value of +isDone+, so that when one changes, the other changes automatically. Let's tie it all together:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.CheckboxView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  classNames: ['checkbox'],

  template: SC.Handlebars.compile('<label><input type="checkbox">{{title}}</label>'),

  titleBinding: '.parentView.content.title',
  
  valueBinding: '.parentView.content.isDone'
});
</javascript>

Notice that +Todos.CheckboxView+ provides its own template.  Since it is a simple template, we've compiled it directly in the class.  Alternatively, we could have used the +templateName+ property again with the name of another Handlebars template file in +apps/todos/resources/templates+.

Before you reload the browser to see the new checkbox todo list items, the stylesheet we provided includes a CSS class meant to give completed todos a unique look, so lets also bind the class of each item to the object's isDone property.

We'll use a property on the collection helper to set up this binding:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- replacing the previous code -->

{{#collection Todos.TodoListView itemClassBinding="content.isDone"}}
    {{view Todos.CheckboxView}}
{{/collection}}
</javascript>

This property defines a binding on each of the item views. Each item will get the class +is-done+ if its associated content object's +isDone+ property is +true+. SproutCore will automatically dasherize property names into class names.

NOTE: All views have a number of properties, including +id+, +class+, and +classBinding+. The +collection+ helper allows you to prefix any of those properties with +item+, which will then apply them to each of the child item views. For instance, if you use the +itemClass+ property on a collection, each item will get that class.

Now reload your application in the browser and try it out. As soon as you click a todo's checkbox, the text will become crossed out. Keep in mind you didn't need to update any views when marking the +Todo+ as done; bindings did it for. If a different part of the app changes the +Todo+ item's +isDone+ property, your list item would automatically update without any more work on your part.

h3. The More You Know

We can now create todos and mark them as being complete. While 76% of all statistics are made up, let's see if we can display more accurate information from the data we have.  At the top of our list, let's display the number of todos remaining. Open +todos.handlebars+ and insert this new view:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- after the Todos.CreateTodoView -->

{{#view Todos.StatsView id="stats"}}
  {{displayRemaining}}
{{/view}}
</html>

The +bind+ helper, <code>{{key}}</code>, allows us to automatically update the DOM when a property on our view changes. In this case, we're saying that the content os the Todos.StatsView should be bound to the value of the view's +displayRemaining+ property.  As with the other bindings, this will be automatically updated for us whenever the value changes.

Let's go ahead and implement that view in +todos.js+ now:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.StatsView = SC.TemplateView.extend({
  remainingBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.remaining',

  displayRemaining: function() {
    var remaining = this.get('remaining');
    return remaining + (remaining === 1 ? " item" : " items");
  }.property('remaining').cacheable()
});
</javascript>

+displayRemaining+ contains a pluralized string, based on the number of remaining todos.  Here is another core piece of SproutCore in action, this one called a *computed property*. Computed properties are properties whose value is determined by running a function. For example, if +remaining+ equals +1+, +displayRemaining+ will contain the string +"1 item"+.

We say that +displayRemaining+ *depends on* +remaining+ because it requires another value to generate its own value. We list these *dependent keys* inside the +property()+ declaration.

We've also bound the view's +remaining+ property to the +todoListController+'s +remaining+ property. This means that, because of the dependency chain we've described, if +Todos.todoListController.remaining+ changes, +displayRemaining+ will automatically update.

When we have information that views need but is based on aggregate information about our models, the array controller is a good place to put it. Let's add a new computed property to +todoListController+ in +todos.js+:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating previous code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  remaining: function() {
    return this.filterProperty('isDone', false).get('length');
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

Here, we specify our dependent key using +@each+. This allows us to depend on properties of the array's items. In this case, we want to update the +remaining+ property any time +isDone+ changes on a +Todo+.

NOTE: The +@each+ property also updates when an item is added or removed.

It's important to declare dependent keys because SproutCore uses this information to know when to update bindings. In our case, our +StatsView+ updates any time +todoListController+'s +remaining+ property changes.

Here's how it all fits together:

<div style='text-align: center'>
  !images/html_based/bindings.png!
</div>

INFO: As we build up our application, we create *declarative* links between objects. These links describe how application state flows from the model layer to the HTML in the presentation layer.

h3. Clearing Completed Todos

As we populate our list with todos, we may want to periodically clear out those we've completed. As you have learned, we will want to make that change to the +todoListController+, and let SproutCore automatically propagate those changes to the DOM.

Let's add a new +clearCompletedTodos+ method to the controller.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  clearCompletedTodos: function() {
    this.filterProperty('isDone', true).forEach(this.removeObject, this);
  }
});
</javascript>

Next, we'll add the HTML to our template and connect it up to a view for event handling. Open +todos.handlebars+ and add a button inside the HTML for +statsView+ as shown here:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- updating existing code -->

{{#view Todos.StatsView id="stats"}}
  {{#view Todos.ClearCompletedView classBinding="isActive"}}
    Clear Completed Todos
  {{/view}}
  {{displayRemaining}} remaining.
{{/view}}
</html>

Now implement the view, +Todos.ClearCompletedView+:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.ClearCompletedView = SC.TemplateView.extend({  
  classNames: ['button'],
 
  // Setting isActive to true will trigger the classBinding and add
  // 'is-active' to our layer's class names.
  mouseDown: function() {
    this.set('isActive', true);
  },
 
  // Setting isActive to false will remove 'is-active' from our
  // layer's class names.
  mouseUp: function() {
    this.set('isActive', false);
    Todos.todoListController.clearCompletedTodos();
  }
});
</javascript>

Go back to your browser and try it out. Add some todos, then mark them done and clear them.  Because we previously bound the visual list to the +todoListController+, making a change through new means has the expected effect.

h3. Marking All as Done

Let's say you've decided to get busy for a day and actually get all of your work done. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to easily mark every todo as complete?

It turns out that, due to our application's declarative nature, all the hard work is already done. We just need a way to mark every +Todo+ complete.

Let's first create a new computed property on our controller that describes whether or not every todo is done. It might look something like this:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  allAreDone: function() {
    return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

INFO: SproutCore has many enumerable helpers. +everyProperty('isDone', true)+ returns true if every item in the array has an +isDone+ property that evaluates to +true+. You can find the full list of helpers in "SC.Enumerable":http://edgedocs.sproutcore.com/symbols/SC.Enumerable.html.

Next, we'll create a checkbox view to mark all items complete and bind its value to the controller's property:

<html filename="in apps/todos/resources/templates/todos.handlebars">
<!-- directly below the Todos.StatsView -->

{{#view Todos.MarkAllDoneView}}
  <label>
    <input class="mark-all-done" type="checkbox"> Mark All as Done
  </label>
{{/view}}
</html>

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// before SC.ready

Todos.MarkAllDoneView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  classNames: ['checkbox'],

  valueBinding: 'Todos.todoListController.allAreDone'
});
</javascript>

If you were to reload your browser and use the app now, you'd notice that clicking all of the checkboxes of your todos will cause the "Mark All as Done" checkbox to become checked. However, it doesn't work in the other direction: clicking "Mark All as Done" has no effect.

So far, our computed properties have described how to calculate a value from dependent properties. However, in this case, we want to accept a new value, and update dependent properties to reflect it.  Lets update our +allAreDone+ computed property to also accept a value.

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.todoListController = SC.ArrayController.create({

  // ...

  allAreDone: function(key, value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
      this.setEach('isDone', value);

      return value;
    } else {
      return this.get('length') && this.everyProperty('isDone', true);
    }
  }.property('@each.isDone')
});
</javascript>

When you set a computed property, your computed property function is called with the property key as the first parameter and the new value as the second. To determine if SproutCore is asking for the value or trying to set it, we examine the +value+ parameter. If it is defined, we iterate through each +Todo+ and set its +isDone+ property to the new value.

Because bindings are bi-directional, SproutCore will set +allAreDone+ to +true+ when the user clicks the "Mark All as Done" checkbox. Conversely, unchecking it will make SproutCore set +allAreDone+ to +false+, unchecking all todos.

Reload the app and add some todos. Click "Mark All as Done". Wow! Each of the individual check boxes gets checked off. If you uncheck one of them, the "Mark All as Done" checkbox un-checks itself.  

INFO: When you use SproutCore, as you scale your UI, you never need to wonder whether a new feature will work consistently with parts of the UI you already implemented. Since you build your view layer to simply reflect the state of your models, you can make changes however you want and see them update automatically.

h2. Addendum: Mobile Devices

So far in this guide, you've created a simple ToDos app that showcased a few of the powerful components of SproutCore.  However, the application does not yet work properly on "mobile" devices, which is to say, small screened devices with touch interfaces and two orientations.  Instead of writing several apps to target each of these existing and future devices, we will instead simply extend the app we already have.

h3. Touch Support

First we need our button and checkboxes to respond to touch events.  Update these views, adding +touchStart+ and +touchEnd+ functions like so:

<javascript filename="in apps/todos/todos.js">
// updating existing code

Todos.ClearCompletedView = SC.TemplateView.extend({

  // ...

  touchStart: function(touch) {
    this.mouseDown(touch);
  },

  touchEnd: function(touch) {
    this.mouseUp(touch);
  }
});

Todos.CheckboxView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  
  // ...

  touchStart: function(touch) { },
 
  touchEnd: function(touch) {
    this.toggleProperty('value');
  }
});

Todos.MarkAllDoneView = SC.TemplateView.extend(SC.CheckboxSupport, {
  
  // ...

  touchStart: function(touch) { },
 
  touchEnd: function(touch) {
    this.toggleProperty('value');
  }
});

SC.ready(function() {
  Todos.mainPane = SC.TemplatePane.append({
    
    // ...

    touchStart: function(touch) {
      touch.allowDefault();
    },

    touchesDragged: function(evt, touches) {
      evt.allowDefault();
    },

    touchEnd: function(touch) {
      touch.allowDefault();
    }
  });
});
</javascript>

For the button, we trigger the mouse handling code that was previously written. For the checkboxes, we toggle the value on each touch and finally, we allow the default actions for un-handled touches in order to leave scrolling to the browser.

h3. Mobile Specific Styles

At this point, we actually have the app fully functional on all modern mobile devices.  It just doesn't "look" right for most of them.  So download "the CSS for mobile":https://github.com/sproutcore/Todos-Example/raw/master/apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos_mobile.css and save it as +apps/todos/resources/stylesheets/todos_mobile.css+.  Now load your app on a mobile device and you should see the same simple app, but styled properly for mobile devices and responding to touch events.

NOTE: The SproutCore development server will be available on your local network at your machine's IP address, ex. http://x.x.x.x:4020/todos

Finally, this is a good time to highlight the fact that we just increased the target base for our app by several fold simply by extending the view layer, all without touching the model or controller layers.  Truly this was a simple example, but SproutCore makes it easy to do the same with large scale applications, allowing you to re-use the core of your application and focus on the user experience per device as you wish.
